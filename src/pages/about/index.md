### Matrixblend Media 

The concept behind Matrixblend came from multiplying matrices in mathematics. When you multiple matrices you get a number that is a sum of all the functions within the matrix, which leads to a greater combination of numbers. This math philosophy is the equation behind Matrixblend media. The more people who contribute their talent and or services, the more value the community becomes.

We seek to empower the user. Using world class tools and access to get mentors anyone can become an asset to the online community. Each influence has path the way to inspire ideas, that can better the future generations. As media becomes more targeted or biased, a platform with individual bias is necessary.
